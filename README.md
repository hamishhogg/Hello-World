I am searching for spreadsheet.xls functionality in a C++ SDK or Lib for a software application installed on a Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit cloud server. I used OpenOffice SDK in 2011 to create custom functions written in C ++ for reading, writing and performing simple computations using Calc in OpenOffice. The custom functions worked well and ran successfully until 2015 when Ubuntu 10.04 lts server was out of support and it crashed

I have tried with a colleague to build versions of Apache Open Office e.g 4.4 SDK on the server. We did not succeed in compiling it without encountering one error after another. Perhaps we should try using LibreOffice SDK and see if we can get it working. 

In case we cannot get Apache Open Office or LibreOffice to compile and run using C++ on a Ubuntu server, I would like to know about open source C++ libraries for reading, writing and performing computations on single spreadsheet.xls or CSV.
